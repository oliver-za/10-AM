## Motivation

The idea behind building this application was to practice apolications which emit data in real-time, from backend to frontend and other way around. For handling this I chose WebSockets library socket.io as it seemed one of the best at doing its job. As a theme for this application I chose coffee shop/wood/city/morning theme.
